It is an exciting period which sees the formation of a distinct Christian art and architecture drawing upon the religious traditions of Judaism and pagan Rome on one hand, and that of imperial power on the other.We will examine a wide range of media (mosaics, frescoes, icons, ivories and luxury objects) in order to gain a rounded view of the art of the Byzantine Empire and we will consider the function of images and objects in specific historical contexts. We will explore the grandeur of Hagia Sophia in Instabul, the mosaics in Constantinople, Ravenna and San Marco in Venice, the extraordinary skills of ivory workers, enamellists and illuminators of manuscripts, and we will relate these treasures to the social, cultural and religious dimensions of this dynamic culture.\nParticular emphasis will be placed on the theory and function of icons or holy images, the use of art to project imperial ideology, the relationship between art and ritual and the appropriation of Byzantine forms and iconography for ideological purposes outside the empire.',

Most of the time, these are faces of people who lived long ago, and their portraits give us access to the way they looked, as well as the way they wanted to represent themselves to society. Yet portraits are also often highly complex constructions designed by major artists; as Leonardo had it, “every painter paints himself”. So what exactly is it that a portrait portrays? Why did people commission their portraits, and what were they used for? What knowledge did people bring to looking at portraits? What did it mean for an artist to paint or sculpt a ‘true likeness’? With a focus on the early modern period, yet including some excursions to both earlier and later periods, this module will address the above questions and more, approaching portraiture from a wide range of perspectives as well as focusing on some of the major practitioners and commissioners of the genre.',

Yet, a ‘golden age’ is only born after the fact, and this module will define the legacy of sixteenth-century Venetian painting into the nineteenth century. Starting with the artistic reception of the Venetian Cinquecento by such renowned artists as Rubens, Rembrandt, Tiepolo and Reynolds, we will cover topics as wide-ranging as private collecting, print-making, artistic theory, early art museums, the rise of connoisseurship, theft and looting. We will examine current theories of reception as well as an abundance of period sources. Eventually, we will develop an understanding of one of the distinctive features of artworks in general: remaining when their makers have long passed, they take on ever new meanings and functions.',

We will analyse how artists working in film and photography, together with social art practice, community-based work, and performance have been particularly drawn to the social sciences, considering the problematic as well as generative aspects of this overlap. While focussing on contemporary art, the module looks back to the complex histories of artistic overlap with anthropology and ethnography, and the way in which these have been continued and confronted in recent curatorial and display strategies.',

   { description: 'Scandinavian design of the last century is perceived as synonymous with understated elegance, functional integrity, natural symbiosis and inclusive, egalitarian thinking. Its seemingly timeless appeal (today’s young Scandinavians still aspire to own many of the same design ‘classics’ as their parents) is underpinned by the unique characteristics of this northern region, known to its inhabitants as ‘Norden’. This module explores these distinctive design aesthetics and the artistic, historical, social and political factors behind their development. Looking primarily at Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland, but also inviting students to expand their own potential fields of interest in Iceland, Greenland or the Faroe Islands, it addresses the fertile marriage of architecture and design. Themes include the centrality of the ‘home’, the deep relationship to landscape and nature, the importance of Scandinavian forms of social democracy and the fundamental belief in the egalitarian notion of ‘Beauty for All’.',

   { description: 'This module spans Mediterranean history from the seventh to the third century BCE, examining autocracy in its many forms. From Tarquinius Superbus in Rome to Pisistratus in Athens; from Dionysius I to the Roman dictators, the module uses a broad historical scale to pose questions about the nature of rulership and the ways in which individuals wielded power in classical times. What was the difference between a basileus and a tyrannos? What did Dionysius of Halicarnassus mean when he referred to the Roman dictatorship as an \'elective tyranny\'? How could a notoriously cruel tyrant like Periander of Corinth gain a posthumous reputation as a lawgiver and sage? By examining instances of sole rule through the works of historians (from Herodotus to Livy) and philosophers (from Plato to Cicero), students will gain an understanding of the workings of political power in antiquity, and the ways in which ancient writers have themselves influenced modern formulations of ancient politics.',

The main project is preceded by a review essay. There is no specific syllabus for this module. Students taking the M. Phys. degree select a project from a list of those which are available, and are supervised by a member of the academic staff. Project choice and some preparatory work is undertaken in semester one, but normally most of the 60 credits\' worth of work is undertaken in semester two.\nThe aim is that students provide the intellectual drive for the project work, and should take on a role similar to that of a research student in the School. Support will be offered by the academic staff member(s) supervising the project and sometimes also by other members of a research team. Many projects will be carried out in one of the astronomy computing clusters, but other arrangements are possible. The review essay that precedes experimental work is worth 10 credits, ie should have about 100 hours of work invested in it. This work is expected to be directly useful to the subsequent studies.',

Biographies of philosophers, often written by other philosophers, reflect this preoccupation with the practical, presenting philosophers as examples of how to live, teach and act. This module examines the functions, purposes and contexts of philosophical biography, considering the interconnections and interplay between biography and philosophy in antiquity. The focus will be the philosophy of the Roman Imperial period (including the Second Sophistic) and Late Antiquity and texts such as Porphyry’s On Abstinence from Killing Animals, Eunapius’ Lives of the Philosophers, and Iamblichus’ On the Pythagorean Way of Life will be considered.',

Our goal is to better understand the historical and theoretical background to common moral arguments nowadays; often we are familiar with the arguments without perceiving their presuppositions or genealogies. In particular, we will seek to understand how Christian ethics relates to the ethos of liberal democracy, which is oriented toward rights, freedom, and equality. Is Christian ethics fundamentally compatible with, or in tension with, values such as freedom of speech and a secular state? We seek to answer this question by careful study of issues such as abortion, euthanasia, global poverty, the use of religious reasons in public debate, same-sex marriage, and war.',

The first half treats the elements and history of the doctrine of creation: the way creation is known; God as the agent of creation; the divine action of creation; the natures and ends of creatures; the second half treats the elements and history of the doctrine of providence: knowledge of providence; providence and the nature of God; the divine act providence; nature and history as the spheres of providence. The module concludes with consideration of the relation between creation, providence and the divine work of reconciliation. This module provides an opportunity for the study of Christian teaching about creation and divine providence in its historical and systematic dimensions, and for reflection on some characteristic modern questions about the topic.',

International markets matter for trade and aid while international bodies such as the World Bank play a crucial role. Understanding the causes of underdevelopment can help us understand how to unlock the sustained growth experienced by developed economies. Specific topics can include income inequality, poverty, education, corruption, gender, foreign investment, aid, microfinance and international trade policy. The course will draw on evidence across countries and over time, with an emphasis on developing an analytical understanding of the applied issues.',

The rise of the use of experimental methods in economics has created a useful dialogue between theoretical and laboratory-based empirical work. Typically, this process occurs as follows: experimental economists use human participants to test the behavioural implications of theoretical models in the laboratory; the new lab empirical evidence then suggests new venues for the development of novel theoretical models. This cycle then repeats itself. This module will look at the interplay between the development of theoretical models and empirical evidence collected in the laboratory.\nTopics covered will include: experimental double and posted offer auctions in spot and forward markets; experimental asset markets; experiments on structured bargaining: finite alternating-offer bargaining games; experiments on strategic-form games; Behavioural Models.

The structure of the module is both chronological and thematic, addressing issues such as gender, class, religion, and nation in relation to Victorian poetry. Throughout, the module uses the background of visual art - including poetry book illustration, Victorian paintings based on subjects from Victorian poetry, and artworks commemorated in Victorian poems - to highlight issues regarding poetry\'s status, aims, and appearance in the period. Looking at the art of poetry in relation to visual art, it asks how Victorian poetry aligns itself with broader aesthetic debates about form, function, and representation. (Group C)',

And what role did writers from the ‘Celtic fringe’ of the British archipelago play in reinvigorating and reconfiguring the literary canon in the period between 1914 and 1939? By analysing a diverse range of texts from Scottish, Irish and (Anglo-)Welsh writers – from formal as well as socio-political perspectives – we will explore alternative views of the Modernist period: in particular we will examine the relationship between the Irish Literary Revival and the Scottish Renaissance, and between the Celtic periphery and the metropolitan centre, and also the ways the writers studied turned the English language, and its hierarchies and traditions, back on itself.

As a site, the cinema can be conceptualised as a public arena where the meanings of a culture are negotiated, not simply disseminated. What has been forgotten, what has been elided, and what should be remembered? What is the relationship between these cultural histories and the work of individual filmmakers? The module will introduce different methodologies for the study of national cinemas, either through a specific national cinema (such as the cinemas of Britain, Canada, India, Italy, South Korea or Spain) or through a comparative focus.

The view taken in this module is that unexplained exceptions indicate that the grammarians have got the rule wrong. We look at two rules of modern German to see how a close examination of their unexplained exceptions can point to a new and better rule: the passive and non-passivisable transitive verbs; and tense formation and strong verbs.',

This revival appears to have been prompted by such factors as the radical reconfiguration of real (and imaginary) geographies in the wake of German Reunification. At the same time as this resurgence, there occurred a shift in cultural studies referred to as the "spatial turn". Theorists of culture were becoming interested in how constructing and negotiating space bears upon identity. In this module the insights of the spatial turn are applied to the reading of the newest German-language travel writing.',

The main purpose of this module is to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of how major scholars, past and contemporary, have theorised about the dynamics of international relations. The theories generally make a number of propositions which sometimes offer conflicting perspectives, but also occasionally overlap. Our main task will be to outline, critique, compare and contrast the assumptions and values which underlie each of these theories so students may enhance their own critical understanding of IR as well as form their own perspectives.',

This necessity is due to the obvious historical roots of many of today\'s pressing problems in IR. This module will take a number of key themes (initially and for example), war, peace and empire, that have been often separately explored by IR and IH scholars and show how the two disciplines can reinforce and deepen the understanding of what we broadly call the \'international\'. A series of case studies will be used, initially (and for example) that of the origins of the conflict in Palestine/ Israel; that of the origins of the Balkan conflicts of the 1990s, and; that of the roots of the decline of the British Empire in the period before, during and after the First World War. Each student will be expected to undertake historical research based on a use of secondary sources and also a study based on the use of primary, even archival sources. ',

The module documents the conflicts of the twentieth century and seeks to understand to what degree they have been overcome or have evolved as a result of conflict transformation processes involving both national and international actors that accompanied regional democratisation. The module engages with theoretical approaches central to core subjects of international relations and political science, juxtaposing said theoretical analyses with discussions based upon comparative empirical research in the region. The module is of relevance to students interested in Latin America and in those conceptual frameworks relating to conflict and peace studies and introduces broader academic discussions relating to theories of conflict, peacebuilding, the State, social movements, democracy and human rights. The module will also provide instruments to those students interested in developing a career in public policy and policy-making in national and international institutions.',

   { description: 'This module aims to explore how security is conceptualised within the disciplines of Critical Security and Geopolitical Studies. The point of departure is to explore how security how is security made and unmade through processes of interaction. Addressing this issue raises several important questions about where the boundaries of security begin and end. Does it matter if the boundaries between different spheres of interaction overlap and criss-cross? How do these points of intersection coexist and interact? How can we map the construction and implementation of security in zones of visibility and invisibility? \n\nOur aim is to take these questions forward by unpacking several separate yet interrelated security issues ranging from the environment to flags to migration to torture and the media, among others established and emerging scholarly debates. Overall the course argues that the boundaries of security are not just material objects. Instead they are conceptualised as sites of linguistic contestation that empowers and disempowers different modes of action. Taking this viewpoint challenges the idea that the boundaries are becoming redundant in an age of globalization. Mapping how we speak about security, and how this language is put into practice, forces us to acknowledge while boundaries are changing they remain important emblems and modalities of international relations.',

Armed forces are both essential to states’ security, yet also pose a latent threat to governments. Indeed, many more governments are overthrown by military coups d’état than succumbed to foreign invasions. Consequently, governments in developing states face the challenge of ensuring themselves against the risk of military interventions in politics. While the menace of military interventions in politics hangs over developing states, even advanced industrial democracies face challenges in their civil-military relations. \nTo shed light on these issues, we will first (weeks 1-2) examine the timeless questions of civil-military relations (through classic texts) as well as how the changing nature of military organizations over time. Then, we will focus (weeks 3-6) on debates about the impact of different modes of civil-military governance in developed states. Finally, in the four final sessions (weeks 7-10), we will examine civil-military relations in developing states, devoting particular attention to the causes and consequences of military coups d’état.)',

Indeed, there is probably no area of contemporary international politics that has not, in some way, had to engage with the question of the transformative importance (or otherwise) of the Internet. Moreover, the Internet is itself governed by complex, contested, still remarkably ill-defined and sometimes unprecedented forms of global and international politics. The politics of the Internet – perhaps as much as the Internet itself – may be of great importance in shaping the way international relations works in the future. In this module, students will be offered an overview of the international politics of the Internet, and the implications of the Internet for international politics.',

   { description: 'The goal of this course is to introduce students to academic debates and theoretical frameworks that give insights into the impact of armaments (their development, characteristics and proliferation) on international relations. As IR scholars have long recognized, the availability of modern armaments is a key determinant of the international distribution of power. Some have even gone so far as argue that the technological characteristics of armaments fundamentally determines the nature of the international state system. Meanwhile, certain policymakers and NGOs contend that arms dynamics (e.g. arms races and the spread of light weapons) contribute directly to the outbreak of wars. This course will equip students with the analytic tools needed to critically examine both these issues and others.\n\nTo accomplish this objective, the course will first (weeks 2-5) examine broad theories about how the development of distribution of armaments affects the international state system. Then, the course will focus (weeks 6-7) on the particular issue of whether the ‘excessive’ production and/or availability of armaments can cause wars. Finally, in the course’s three last sessions (weeks 8-10), we will examine how contemporary phenomena—the globalization and Europeanization of arms production—are shaping this particular domain. Ultimately, the understanding that students will gain through this course will enhance their development as political scientists and their ability to work in fields as diverse as: government, NGOs, international organizations, and the corporate sector.',

The module will aim to help understand the historical roots and contemporary impulses that help shape Africa\'s international relations. The module explores how Africa\'s nation-states and peoples interact with multilateral development banks, international institutions, aid organisations and other actors (including both "normal" external states and clandestine networks of accumulation). We will consider Africa\'s debt and its impact upon the continent\'s international relations, acknowledging that it is unsustainable but asking if total debt write-off is feasible or desirable. Why Africa\'s share in world trade is declining and the impact this has on the continent will also be discussed as will the role of trade restrictions and the WTO in shaping Africa\'s international relations. We will ask what is the logic of regional integration and can it work in Africa, whilst examining the stated goals of political unity and economic progress through the African Union. Is this just rhetoric or is there now hope for solid achievements on both political and economic fronts? We finish with an evaluation with the latest plan to put Africa on the global map: the New Partnership for Africa\'s Development (NEPAD).',

At its smallest, the umbrella only captures the bare bones of the concept: peace means absence of war and violence. As it grows in diameter, the umbrella of peace starts to include other factors: first, it captures some agreement on rules regulating conflict and disagreement, then agreement on some basic values, then the bond of solidarity, of fraternity and friendship. This module introduces students to prominent theories of peace in the western tradition and provides them with a foundation for understanding the meaning and significance of peace in different historical circumstances.',

The use of the concept is, however, frequently misused and the outcome of rights campaigns is often far from the original intention. In exploring these complex issues the module is divided into two parts. In PART I the long-standing and polarising debate between liberal and Marxian theories regarding the role of the concept of human rights in society will be examined. Many theorists are now attempting to go beyond this divide to think through the potential for the concept in the process of social transformation. The social constructionist and neo-Gramscian approaches to the concweptualisation of human rights will be introduced. Drawing on this theoretical discussion a series of contemporary issues will be explored in PART II and the focus will be on suitability of the concept in any programme of social transformation by considering the role - nationally and internationally - of the legal system, economic relations, government and non-government organisations.',

The complex network of commodities and goods traded between developed and developing economies are explored through a series of case studies and the increased securitisation of development in the twenty-first century is examined.',

It explores the various manifestations of violence in its physical, structural, and symbolic forms, and explores the psychological motivations that promote or inhibit violence. Students will closely examine a series of events, both historical and contemporary, which are variously described as motivated by conflicts of ethnicity, class, race or clan membership. Students will explore the processes by which enemies are identified and maintained; how collectivities define their membership, and whether reconciliation after a violent conflict is possible. The module approaches the analysis of these conflicts from a multidisciplinary perspective. ',

Bluntly, gender, similarly to race and class, is a tool for the construction and maintenance of power. The process of ‘gendering’ expects different actions and grants different agency to particular actors based upon their biological sex. This often reflects a power differential which has historically (and continues) to privilege men and masculinised subjects over women and feminised subjects. This has a significant impact on International Relations and thus Terrorism Studies. Gender also affects the way that we construct and conceive of actors—groups and individuals—who use political violence.',

It will therefore give an opportunity for students to reflect on the links between the history and political implications of a particular event as well as to look at how theorists of international order have built the Great War into their analyses. Students will be encouraged to examine both the War’s contemporary (1914 – 1939) impact on international relations as well as the more recent debate on order and international society led by IR scholars from the 1990s and up till now, but also by international historians, looking in particular at the lasting impact of the war on issue areas like the Middle East, European Union and Great Power rivalry',

   { description: 'Eastern political strategies and thought, while often resting on different assumptions to  their Western counterparts, have in a context of globalization spread into very different contexts than those from which they originated. Sun Tzu is included in the canon of realist thought and often informs contemporary corporate strategy; Gandhi’s satyagraha has provided impetus to nonviolent movements across the globe; Thich Quang Duc’s self-immolation in Vietnam (1963) has been imitated in a number of contexts since.  Jihad has become a global phenomenon. These are strategies with origins in ancient Eastern thought that have been put to use in contemporary political struggles. The question of agency is important in so far as non-Western societies have for the last several hundred years been in a structurally weak position vis a vis the expansion of Western power across the globe. Non-western philosophies have informed strategies of resistance or independence but may, in very different ways, become significant as India and China become global players. There has been a lively debate within International Relations theory about the potential importance of alternative modes of thought, more indigenous to these cultures, in the evolution of the future strategies of these emerging powers. The purpose of this module is to explore a range of ‘classic’ and secondary texts that express different elements of non-Western thought, both ancient and contemporary, to understand the underlying assumptions about the body, political community and the world, the objectives and workings of various strategies, both violent and nonviolent, the relationship between strategic choice and, on the one-hand, the contextual, social and/or political location of the agents, and, on the other hand, the relevance of these strategies for understanding contemporary global politics, ethics and science.',

Of all the Soviet republics, the five of Central Asia - Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan - had been the largest net recipients of Soviet aid, had benefited most economically from the Soviet Union and had thus been the most reluctant to break from the Soviet empire. Once the path of independence was followed, each of these five states faced considerable ethnic, state, economic, social and foreign policy challenges. This course aims to analyse these nation- and state-building agendas, seeking to address critically some of the now widely held assumptions about this post-Soviet area. Moreover, located in one of the world\'s most strategic zones, between Russia, China and a troubled Middle East, Central Asia relies on its substantial human and natural resources in the renegotiation of its geopolitical status.',

   { description: 'One of the major issues of twentieth century (international) political thought was that of the fate of liberal thought and democratic politics in light of progressive secularisation and rationalisation experienced by Western societies during the late ninteenth and early twentieth centuries. The combination of radical technological advancement and grand-scale social and economic transformation marking the transition into an age of mass politics and industrialised violence formed the background of what is often called the crisis of modern politics. The main characteristic of this new predicament was an acute sense of disorientation and loss of meaning following the collapse of the moral and civilisational standards of the nineteenth century. Philosophers like Nietzsche spoke of the death of God and the advent of the era of European nihilism to denote the retreat of metaphysical certainties in late modernity. The development of new forms of mechanised destruction and the rise of totalitarian forms of government triggered trenchant critiques of liberal politics and an agonising search for viable forms of political and social organisation that would save modernity from itself, i.e. rethink the nature of democratic politics in the age of mass-societies. This module will introduce students to the various diagnoses of modernity’s civilisational malaise using the concepts of evil and tragedy as categorical indices to describe what went wrong with modernity. The second part of the module will explore theological and secular responses to the multiple crisis of liberal politics ranging from liberal conservative (Morgenthau), social democratic (Arendt, Frankfurt School) to Christian realist attempts to save modernity from itself as well as radical postmodern theological critiques of modernity.',

Research in this area is designed to answer the question: Why do states do what they do in international politics? The module is organised in a basic "levels of analysis" framework that roughly corresponds to the historical development of the study of foreign policy analysis – from outside, ‘external’ approaches associated with general international relations theories, to societal sources of culture and public opinion, to government organization and elite decision-making. An emphasis will be given to decision-making approaches to foreign policy, with a particular focus on psychological dimensions. The political psychology of foreign policy decision-making has become a dominant area of research in foreign policy analysis and offers a unique, complimentary perspective to an understanding of international relations. The emphasis in the course is on theories of foreign policy, as well as bridging from theories to practice. Students will also be exposed to the substance/content of the foreign policies of various countries.',

The module draws not only on terrorism studies but also on scholarship from a wide range of subject areas including war studies, psychology, sociology, theology, anthropology, history and art. The focus is more on individuals’ aims, aspirations, and ways of imagining themselves and their actions, rather than organisational and instrumental purposes.

Attention is paid to their internal development and to issues of national identity but weight is also given to the full range of contacts between the princes and peoples of Britain and the wider world, in particular via the Church and through extensive ties with France and the Low Countries.

Rather than providing an exhaustive chronology of political events, the course examines key themes that helped to shape Western Europe in this period. This will enable students to understand not just the major events that occurred in the period (including, for example, the contest between the Western Emperors and the Popes, or the Crusades), but also the mentalities and lives of the people who experienced them. Topics such as belief, dissent and private life are considered alongside more traditional areas like the development of national governments and trade. The module, while self-contained and coherent, will follow neatly on from ME1003, a module dealing with the transformation of Europe in the early Middle Ages.',

It deals with the defining period between 1350 and 1420 which witnessed the formation and development of different types of frontier societies in the Welsh marches, the Anglo-Scottish borders and the frontiers between English and Gaelic nations in Ireland and Scotland. The course also examines the efforts of royal governments and aristocratic dynasties to manage them. The expeditions of Richard II to Ireland, the Lordship of the Isles, the Douglas and Percy families and Owain Glyn Dwr provide examples of the dynamism and significance of marchlands in this period. The influence which borderlands exercised on the wider patterns of politics in the realms of the isles provides a major strand of discussion as does the significance of ideas of race and nation in providing a framework for political and social attitudes in this period.',

It was from the 1290s, however, that tensions began to build between England and France in the regions (such as Gascony, Scotland and the Low Countries) which were to play the crucial role in the outbreak of war in 1337, and it was during the first two decades of the fourteenth century - at Courtrai in 1302, for example, and at Bannockburn in 1314 - that the new military tactics which were to prove so effective after 1337 were developed. The initial aim of this module is to study the diplomatic and military history of England, France and their allies both in the build-up to full-scale war and during the first two phases (1337-96) of what is known as the Hundred Years War. It also looks in detail at areas such as military organisation, the chivalric ethos, the laws and customs of war in relation to things such as sieges or the treatment of prisoners of war, the economic and social impact of war, and the literature of war. A substantial part of the course will be devoted to in-depth study of contemporary chronicles of the war, particularly the chronicles of Jean Froissart.',

Scotland provides a useful case study for the examination of chivalry in the late Middle Ages: the Wars of Independence, the Hundred Years War, the Wars of the Roses, and the forging of an expanding web of political alliances by the Stewarts (one of the most successful ruling dynasties in Europe) make Scotland a fertile ground for exploring the nature of medieval kingship and the importance of chivalry.',

   { description: 'Through much of the British Isles the opening decades of the fourteenth century were characterised by war and political troubles. The Scottish war, which had begun in the 1290s, intensified and widened through the 1300s and 1310s. The ambitions of Robert Bruce were at the heart of this extended conflict which spread from Scotland into northern England and Ireland. His opponent, Edward II of England, experienced revolts in Wales and repeated opposition and civil war in England which culminated in the first deposition of an English king since the Norman Conquest. War and rebellion in England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland involved issues of contemporary political ideology and altered the internal character and external relationships of these lands. This module uses the reigns of Robert Bruce and Edward II to examine issues of kingship, community and identity in the early fourteenth century. It pays special attention to questions of legitimate authority and resistance and examines the way in which major nobles, like Thomas of Lancaster, Roger Mortimer and James Douglas operated as royal lieutenants, leaders of the opposition or regional magnates. Particular focus is placed on the key narratives of the period like the Gesta Edwardi Secundi and John Barbour’s The Bruce and on the place of kingship and community in a wider European context.',

The study of his reign enables us to ask about the origins of Europe, and the transformation of the world of Late Antiquity into that of the Middle Ages. His reign was dominated by brutal but sophisticated military campaigning, which resulted in the rapid establishment of an empire of around 1 million square kilometres. At the same time, however, the emperor surrounded himself with the great scholars of the day, and embarked on an ambitious and serious mission to completely reform society according to Christian moral principles. Charlemagne is therefore a paradoxical and intriguing character. He is also the best documented early mediaeval ruler by some way, and we will use a variety of types of source (including annals, histories, biographies, visions, governmental records, architecture, art and poetry) to examine warfare, court politics, ritual, ideology, the cult of the saints, religious reform and culture in the late eighth and early ninth centuries. We will also study the various pagan, Christian, Islamic and Celtic societies which came under Frankish attack in the period, and consider how Charlemagne was remembered, including the rumours of scandal, incest and visions of the emperor in hell which circulated soon after his death.',

Saussure said that a language is a system, and languages do indeed have rules, in their grammar. But most rules of grammar have a long list of unexplained exceptions - why? The view taken in this module is that unexplained exceptions indicate that the grammarians have got the rule wrong. We look at two grammatical rules to see how a close examination of their unexplained exceptions can point to a new and better rule: the passive and non-passivisable transitive verbs; and tense formation and strong verbs. The main language of illustration is English, but students of Arabic, French, Italian, Persian, Russian and Spanish are encouraged to bring these languages into the discussion. ',

In the first part students will examine the characteristics of international banking and the markets and activities in which international banks operate. In the second part, the module is concerned with the regulation of international banking. The role of institutions such as the World Bank and IMF, and the causes and effects of international banking crises are featured. This module aims to give students a good grounding in the theory and practice of modern international banking and an appreciation of the related policy issues involved.',

One of the most important trends in the development of modern economies is the increased globalisation of business. Notwithstanding its economic and social impact, however, globalisation is having a significant impact on how we manage people, not only in multinational enterprises but in our indigenous companies as, increasingly, we borrow ideas on "best practice" from overseas. Such efforts at globalisation, whilst generally successful in bringing economic success, have been fraught with problems, which are often the consequence of ethnocentric management teams and their attempts to export US-style "best practice" human resource management to other countries.  Thus, it is critically important for globalising firms to make sensible and contextually-sensitive decisions in key areas of human resource management, which take into account institutional, cultural and psychological differences between parent company institutions, values and practices, those of host countries and those of third country nationals employed to work in global organisations. These decisions usually concern such areas as how people are organised, recruited, selected, deployed, developed, motivated, compensated and how their performance is managed. They also focus on whether or not global organisations employ uniform human resource practices in their various locations throughout the world. Ultimately, effective international human resource management (IHRM) rests on a thorough understanding of the problems of managing people from different backgrounds and this module attempts to explore such problems in-depth and help students apply their understanding to practical managerial situations.',

Four key areas will form the bedrock for this analysis: employee resourcing; employee reward; employee relations; and, employee development. The inter-relationships between these four policy and practice areas will be explored and the ways in which they collectively are managed to secure continuous learning and development of people associated with the organisation will be investigated and assessed. For individuals, the benefits of effective management and development activities to which they are exposed are said to lie in enhanced employability, human capital and career management. For the organisation, performance management and improvement are often felt to be underpinned by processes that promote the type of continuous individual and organisational learning necessary in times of rapid change in the competitive environment.

Abhorrent policies including novel forms of taxation and unpopular foreign warfare, implemented by court favourites and flawed monarchs all contributed to the breakdown of government. Religious tensions between groups with widely differing visions of the church further fuelled conflict, as did competing ideologies of government. The Stuart century also included some novel experiences, such as the first period of religious toleration in the 1650s and the growth of party culture and the ‘public sphere’ from the 1670s onwards. This module examines these developments, evaluating competing explanations for the Civil Wars of the 1640s and Revolution of 1688, using a variety of historical approaches and some contemporary documents.

At home the absolute monarchy had great difficulty in adjusting to changing political, social and cultural expectations that would eventually engulf the Bourbon state as its international adventures produced financial bankruptcy. This module will explore France in the reigns of Louis XV and Louis XVI in order to understand the nature of old regime state and society, and the difficulties under which its people and rulers laboured. It will also give students the opportunity to engage with one of the most controversial subjects in European history: the origins of the French Revolution.',

Franco-British relations in this period have been widely assumed to be wholly belligerent and antagonistic: the two nations were, after all, direct competitors for markets, colonial possessions and prestige. But how accurate is this construction? Were Franco-British relations consistently characterised by competitive warmongering, confrontation, and distrust? This course investigates the extent and nature of contact between the two countries, and asks how such interactions affected France’s economy, culture and national identity. We study the waxing and waning of France’s empire and the impact of British competition on France’s economic and industrial development. We then delve into the cultural and intellectual exchanges between the two countries, asking how ideas and cultural artefacts circulated (or failed to circulate) across the Channel, and what impact this had on French culture and society.',

This module investigates how the Iranian world - including central Asia and eastern Anatolia - was shaped by these Turkic dynasties, especially the Timurids and Safavids, and the interplay of different cultural and ethnic forces that shaped the early modern Middle East.

Yet, this conflicting \'sacred/profane\' image has been as much a part of intellectual rhetoric in Russia itself, as it has been the cause for divided opinion abroad. As Russian intellectuals thought about their country\'s cultural (and spiritual) development, past and present, they often did so \'under Western eyes\'. Whether critical or indulgent, their views testify to complex inter-relations with European neighbours. With this in mind, we shall explore a number of leitmotifs in Russian intellectual culture, together with the contexts in which these were first elaborated. In addition, we shall identify instances of their recurrence as a \'resource\' in late and post-Soviet endeavours to re-articulate the \'authentic\' nature of Russian culture.',

Furthermore, in the cracks between the nation-states of the successful nations, the fortunes of the now by and large forgotten ethnic groups of Baltic Germans, Goralians, Kashubs, Latgallians, Mazurs, Poleshuks, Rusyns, Samogitians, Tatars and Varmiaks have waxed and waned.

However, the encroachment of the royal state upon civil society met with both popular and elite resistance that had to be either crushed or defused through compromise deals before stability could emerge under Louis XIV. Students will focus not only upon political and administrative history but also upon associated religious, social and cultural developments, such as the growth of the royal court, the influence of the counter-reformation, the emergence of educational and artistic academies, and changing attitudes towards personal and political conduct.

Serious attempts at mass expulsions and exterminations of entire populaces were first made in the 19th century in the colonies of the European powers. In Europe the phenomenon manifested itself during the 20th century, mainly in attempts to achieve a precise fit of nation-states with their ethnolinguistically defined nations. The massacres (genocide) of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire were followed by mass expulsions of other populations during and after World War I in Central Europe. World War II culminated in the genocide of the Jews and Roma, while after the war an even bigger wave of expulsions occurred. At approximately the same time, socially and nationally defined groups were exterminated or forcibly relocated within the Soviet Union. The internationally accepted conceptualisation and criminalisation of genocide in 1948 did not prevent renewed rounds of expulsions and attempted genocides in the second half of the 20th century in Central and Eastern Europe.',

This course uses textual, visual and material sources to examine the histories of French exploration and empire-building, popular curiosity and collecting, and the making of the modern museum. We will link these themes to broader narratives concerning the significant cultural, social and scientific changes that took place more generally in Enlightenment Europe: education and religion; economic and industrial development, empire and the making of modern science, to name just a few.',

But recent historians have instead depicted Elizabeth as an imperfect monarch who constantly obstructed and infuriated her political and ecclesiastical elite by refusing to marry, name an heir, or decisively reform the English Church. This Special Subject considers how power was negotiated, manipulated, exploited, and managed by Elizabeth and those around her. Integrating the political and religious history of the period, it examines courtiers, favourites, counsellors within and outwith the Privy Council, nobles, and bishops. The major questions of Elizabethan government – the best form of the church, the rule of a woman, the marriage of a queen regnant, and dynastic instability – will be examined to uncover who really held power. Primary sources studied range from contemporary printed works to records of the everyday workings of government, to court plays and the visual culture of rule.',

During the eighteenth century the traditional survival strategies of the smaller states began to fail. The dark side of the enlightenment is the story of the decline and disappearance of so many of these small states. The revolutions that began in 1776 and were followed across Europe and beyond can all be seen as rebellions against empire. This module examines these revolutions and their consequences for the empires that they sought to limit or dismantle. The French Revolution, from being a cosmopolitan revolution to put an end to empire, turned into an attempt to create a global republican empire, and the course looks at the consequences of the Revolution for the ideals that sustained it. It goes on to examine the relationship between states after the Napoleonic Wars, and the consequences of the new forces of industrialism, socialism, utilitarianism, liberalism and democracy.',

The second part engages with different processes that have spurred globalisation since the early modern period – the key focus, however, is on the late-modern period from c.1750. These include processes such as migration, urbanisation, technology or disease. All these topics are formulated in an open and broad manner.

Each topic, both in part I and II, can be taught by at least two different members of staff.

The first three sessions are dedicated to n introduction of the main concepts and methods currently used in the field of transnational history, such as comparison and transfer. Following the introduction of approaches and methods, the module focuses on empirical examples such as the French Revolution, Europe and the Mediterranean World, Intellectuals in interwar France and Germany or the emergence of national opera houses in Western and Central Europe during the nineteenth century.

A central question to be answered is why France succeeded in meeting the first challenge so successfully, as epitomised by the \'Renaissance\' monarchy of Francis I, but then collapsed so weakly in the face of the growth of Calvinism in the second half of the century.',

Moreover, Europeans exported their arts of war to other continents in competition with each other, and their encounters with other peoples in the Mediterranean basin, the Americas and East Asia led to further military adaptation.

Metric spaces can be thought of as particular instances of topological spaces, where the fundamental concept is that of points being \'close\' to each other rather than the precise distance between points. Topological spaces are a powerful generalisation of metric spaces, and have had a profound influence in the development of mathematics. Many examples of metric spaces and topological spaces will be introduced and fundamental ideas within topology will be discussed, including separation axioms, compactness and connectedness.',

Superimposed on this slow motion are relatively fast wave-like motions analogous to surface waves on a pond.

Many of the properties of these nanostructured materials can be understood from their dispersion diagram or optical bandstructure, which is a core tool that will be explored in the module.

However the output of neuronal networks is not fixed but instead is modifiable under different behavioural or developmental circumstances. A major source of flexibility in the output neuronal networks derives from neuromodulation; a process in which the basic operation of the networks remains the same but the strengths of synaptic connections and the integrative electrical properties of neurons in the networks are changed by the actions of a range of neuromodulators.

In contrast, this module explores the ways in which our relations to other people affect what we can know. We begin by focusing on trust and testimony. Under what conditions can we obtain knowledge from one another? Do we need prior evidence of other people’s trustworthiness, or can we take what they say at face value? Do we have a moral obligation to take other people seriously as informants? Can groups of people collectively know something even if none of the individual members knows it? Moving on, we will discuss the following questions: do we require less evidence to trust those with whom we have special relationships of love and friendship? Can two people who confront the same evidence rationally form different beliefs? To what extent can there be non-evidential reasons to believe, as opposed to non-evidential causal effects on belief?',

The module will consider the nature of reasons and their relationship to claims about what I ought to do and believe. Since reasons are central to ethics, practical rationality, and epistemology, understanding reasons is crucial for understanding a huge swathe of philosophy. We explore these issues from both an epistemological and a practical perspective.',

Does truth have one nature, or many natures, or none at all? Secondly, we will consider several important theories of logical consequence.\nHow is consequence related to truth? Does the correct theory of consequence involve proofs or models? Is logic revisable, or is it a presupposed foundation for any such revision?

One task of philosophy is to discover such conceptual deficiencies and provide strategies for improving our conceptual repertoire. We may ask, for instance: should a theory of truth describe our concept of truth, or replace it with a better one? Is one goal of political philosophy to improve the concepts we use for thinking about social reality? If the answer to such questions is yes, then how do we go about doing it?\n',

From the very inception of the Communist state, the rapidly changing urban environment became a focus for cinematic reflection. Conversely, cinema played a fundamental role in forming urban identities through both the projection of an ideal of city life to communities and the collective experience of spectatorship. This module engages with representations of the city in Soviet and post-Soviet cinema as a utopian or dystopian space, a place of revolution, social transformation, warfare, invention, criminality, poverty, and memory. It looks at the ways the city has been understood and portrayed in Soviet cinema, from the use of mise-en-scène, montage, and editing, to dialogue, soundtracks and documentary recordings. The syllabus will include works by prominent Soviet and post-Soviet directors including Sergei Eisenstein, Vladimir Menshov, Aleksei Balabanov, and Valeriia Gai Germanika.  ',

   { description: 'This module is designed to introduce students to anthropological and historical perspectives on Americas (with specific focus on South America). A convenient cover term for the way the material is approached is ethnohistorical. Emphasis will be on the study of particular problems identified by anthropologists and historians. These include topics such as whether contemporary indigenous people are a reliable guide to understanding pre-European conquest societies, how can we understand the cultural mixtures that occurred between African, American and European traditions, the impact of colonialism and neo-colonialism on indigenous and peasant people, and the relationship of people to their environment and so on. The attention to ‘problems’ highlights the importance this module will give to ‘ways of knowing’ about other societies. Can we rely on what people tell us they know? Can historical documents be of use to ethnographers? In this course you will attempt to answer these questions for yourselves through various practical projects and tasks. ',

   { description: 'Until recently, Scottish history was conceived and written almost exclusively as the history of the \'nation\' and ideas of \'nationhood\' and \'national identity\' were the main categories used to define the scope and limits of the subject. However, modern scholarship has questioned and in many cases discarded the conceptual framework of nationhood as either unduly restrictive or anachronistic or both. In its place there has developed a more sophisticated understanding of the complex nature and development of the people - or peoples - who call themselves Scots and of their multiple and often conflicting identities. The purpose of this module is to explore these identities as they developed over time in the broader context of British, imperial and global history. By focusing on specific phases and episodes in Scottish history, students will be made aware of the inadequacy of the discourse of \'nationhood\' when applied to pre-modern times and alerted instead to the significance of other forms of collective identity, whether based on geography, ethnicity, religion, class or gender, and of the Scots\' historically varied and often ambivalent understanding of who and what they were.',

Anthropological approaches to sustainability and development uncover hidden aspects and provide additional critical perspectives. We will examine cultural interpretations of sustainability from through case studies that demonstrate how sustainability interfaces with livelihoods. Lectures will question the idea of one agreed, Western definition of sustainability and of development.\nPart C examines markets and institutions. We begin this section by looking at an iconic institution here in St Andrews, The Links, and how they implement sustainable practices in golf course management. We will accompany this section with a field trip to The Links to see first-hand what goes on there. We will also learn about organisations and management for SD and the corporation is considered as a key organisational unit in the modern economy. The concepts of ethical investment, SD reporting, and organisational change are critical in changing the culture of capitalism as well as providing information to assist you with your social accounting exercise. We move on to practical development decisions by looking at the use of Strategic Environmental Assessment and Environmental Impact Assessment in the UK. We will also explore the contribution of planning to sustainability and environmentally sound development.\nFinally, in Part D we will develop our quantitative analysis skills, by learning how statistics and quantitative analysis can augment and enhance our understanding and evidence of change. These skills will provide a foundation for future methods-based modules at the junior-honours and honours level. Through lab work, we will explore how data and data analysis can provide new and interesting insights into the problems we study.',

   { description: 'Material wealth has arguably created a ‘culture of surplus’ through which the pursuit of improved personal well-being has involved ever greater consumption of material goods, leaving in its wake a legacy of environmental problems (Ryan and Deci 2001). Yet across the world, people have often reported having long and happy lives (‘happy life years’), whilst consuming different levels of resources (Seaford 2011). The security of these resources varies enormously too with potential implications for well-being, and much of this security is changing with increasing global connectivity and shifts from subsistence to monetary economies (Fazey et al., 2011). This module draws on evidence and literature from across several disciplines (for example, geography, psychology, sociology, politics) to explore the relationship between personal well-being and planetary well-being (via environmental behaviour). It will look at and critically assess models of personal well-being and environmental behaviour, notions of the ‘good’ life, and behaving ‘well’. It will also explore debates around responsibility for personal well-being and environmental behaviour, and how that is manifest in processes of policy-making.',
